### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
- I'm a fresh Computer Science Engineering graduate
- My current focus is web development with technologies such as TypeScript, Python, React and Node
- I'm currently learning Next.js and performance optimiziation of websites
- I'm working on my portfolio website
- I'm open to job opportunities and would like to get into open source
- Fun fact: I'm an aspiring polyglot, I speak Hungarian, English, Japanese, studied German for 8 years (but I'm not using it much anymore, so I've become quite rusty) and I'm currently also learning French
